# SYA-2021

This repository holds all projects I did in school in the year 2020/2021 \
Therefore I don't follow a gitflow in here as this repository only serves the purpose other class mates can easily view
my solution and get inspirations from it.

As this is a school project, I will not accept any Pull Requests. Also you should not expect fast answers in issues.
